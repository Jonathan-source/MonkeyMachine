# MonkeyMachine

MonkeyMachine is a rendering engine which is written in C++ and uses the DirectX11 API. This is an educational project with the single purpose of 
learning DirectX11 and demonstrate various graphical techniques and features. The project is currently on hold, until I can allocate some free time for it.
