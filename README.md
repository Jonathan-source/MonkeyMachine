# MonkeyMachine

MonkeyMachine is a rendering engine which is written in C++ and uses the DirectX11 API. This is an educational project with the single purpose of 
learning DirectX11 and demonstrate various graphical techniques and features. The project is constantly improving when I have some free time for it.
